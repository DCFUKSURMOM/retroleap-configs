My personal kernel and buildroot configs for retroleap

Kernel Config: lf2000-kernel-config

Buildroot Config: lf2000-buildroot-config (configured for this buildroot environment https://github.com/andymcca/retroleap.git, but should work with the
regular buildroot environment https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap.git)

LF2000-OC-Patch = the patch files used for the kernel. Normal users wont need this. The OC kernel on my github (https://github.com/DCFUKSURMOM/lf2000_kernel-oc.git)
already has this applied, this is just a backup.

The patch was provided by mac2612 (https://github.com/mac2612) but its not on their GitHub (yet). In the future I
want to add a slightly less overclocked patch for devices that dont like the 800mHz, I'll have to talk to mac2612 or andymcca about getting it working as its
out of my skill level.
